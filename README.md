# Results

The recognized limitation with the Hough Circle detection-oriented approach used previously was an unacceptably high number of False Negatives (failures to detect a pot when there was a pot to be detected). Having manually QC'd the SAM-generated `.geojson` output in QGIS, there are a total of 80 pots that were undesireably filtered out by our automated workflow; out of ~16,000 detected pots, that is a Type II (False Negative) error rate of 0.5%.

As for Type I error (False Positive, or detecting a pot when there is no pot to detect), there are 3 polygons (one is a green box next to a pot, and two are squares from the checkerboard ground control objects) that were not filtered out when they should have been; FlyPix's workflow output contained much more undersired geometry, in comparison (too much to easily count).

Regarding accuracy:

* FlyPix average deviation ([`32-35_transparent_mosaic_group1_20241121163322.tif`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yk3OA8OIgmL8BYlZnO5rl0ZJhcQzRslA/view?usp=sharing)): 1.394 cm
* SAM average deviation ([`32.tif`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17TsZtBEhz9w3ymWQb7dllykLDIaCpYPg/view?usp=sharing)): 1.199 cm
* SAM average deviation ([`33.tif`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NR6nKKw-MGjxFQQPExBPtURTspkpY1n5/view?usp=sharing)): 1.219 cm
* SAM average deviation ([`34.tif`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bWFN69mWeXfez9DtQqapQ6e2EnriSVFy/view?usp=sharing)): 1.181 cm
* SAM average deviation ([`35.tif`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u1AOgR9OYWjCsKGLkbHNAHIx5j3UEsm0/view?usp=sharing)): 1.070 cm 

**Total SAM average deviation (32-35)**: 1.167 cm --> <ins>19.52% more accurate</ins>

Finally, regarding compute time and resources:

A single T4 GPU was able to produce the `.geojson` output, the deviation reports, and the centroid CSVs in `WGS84` in under an hour.

# Conclusion

As was mentioned in the last recorded update, further refinement is required to keep all the polygons we want and to filter out all the ones we don't -- the work continues, thank you for your patience!
